      Server side rendering makes the server do all the hard work, instead of
      the client. When doing server side rendering, the client do not have to
      use much cpu power to assemble and prepare all the pages to display to the
      user. This have some benefits. One being that the page is fast, since
      everything is loaded and compiled beforehand. It also is more optimal for
      SEO reasons, because now a web crawler will not see an empty site when
      browsing your site, and therefore you might rank higher on search engines.

    <h2>The public folder</h2>

      We can make our static files, like css, javascript, and image files
      available to the client via. the public folder. A little bit of setup is
      required, as we need to specify that this folder is open to the public. It
      is not getting served per default! It is really quite simple, and require
      just one line of code.
